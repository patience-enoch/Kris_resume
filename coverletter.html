        At Victory Street Sweepers, I contribute to the assembly and refinement of wiring harnesses, working closely with engineers to ensure each system meets operational and safety standards. This collaborative role has deepened my understanding of vehicle systems and strengthened my problem-solving skills.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through FairWay Manufacturing, I’ve built high-performance harnesses tailored to client specifications. From layout design to final testing, I take pride in craftsmanship that delivers both reliability and performance in the field.
      </p>
